This project contains an example of how to use CSS Grid, in this case to style a Form.

Prepared by web development instructor Dougal Mac Gregor as part of his lessons on Web Development.

# Study Notes:

Remember that there are more than one way to define rows and columns on a Grid.

Use Flexbox for layouts where there is only one column, or only one row; and use Grid for
layouts where you have both at least two columns and at least two rows.
